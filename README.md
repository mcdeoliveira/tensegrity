# tnsgrt

This package contains classes and functions that facilitate the design and analysis of tensegrity structures.
It started as a matlab toolbox many years ago written by Mauricio de Oliveira and Joseph Cessna, which is now been
ported to Python.

It relies heavily on `numpy <https://numpy.org>`_, `scipy <https://scipy.org>`_, `pandas <https://pandas.org>`_, and
`cvxpy <https://cvxpy.org>`_ for computations.

Visualization is supported via `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ and
`vispy <https://vispy.org>`_.

## Installation

Install with pip by typing:

    pip install tnsgrt
